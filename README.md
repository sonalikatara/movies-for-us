# Movie Time

A small web app for finding information about all of your favorite movies using the The Movie Database API

## Project Setup

The UI uses css styles, Styled components and bootstrap library. I started wil css and added the other libraries as needed, ideally I would clean up the code to be more consistent in using the same library if possible.
### client
The client application is in the /client folder. 
It was created using create-react app and it uses ReactRouter for client side routing. it runs on port 3000.
### server
An express server running on the server at port 9000


## Installation and Launching 

1. Download the project https://github.com/sonalikatara/movies-for-us

2. At the root folder set the poort to run the server
   if you are running on a MAC book
   run
   $ yarn install 
   $ PORT=9000 yarn start
   or
   $ npm install
   $ PORT=9000 npm start

3. Listen the server on http://localhost:9000
  you can test it by running  http://localhost:9000/movies

4. Now, to start the client app
   $ cd client

   $ yarn install
   $ yarn start
   or
   $ npm install
   $ npm start

 5. Listen the client on http://localhost:3000

I have not added my .env file to .gitignore so that it is available to you, the .env files must always be kept in the .gitignore folder.

## Features
1. When first loaded, the user sees a list of the most popular movies and a search bar.
2. A user is able to search for a movie by title in the search bar, and the matching results should show up in the list of movies. This list is responsive and has infinite scroll.
3. A user can click on a movie in the list and be taken to a page that displays more details for the movie (title, movie poster,ratings, categories, release date,overview, etc).
4. A user can see a list of similar movies on the movie page.
5. A user can also view a list of popular movies created by Walt Disney Studios ( search by production_company ). The backend API provides the capability to discover movies based on different parameters, so the client app can create more components to display movies queried on different properties.
6. A user can also view a list of popular movies of the Animation Genre ( search by genres ).
7. The app caches the popular movies, animation movies and disney movies in the browserâ€™s local storage and uses it to display content when the server is slower offline.
 
## Motivation
